# subtitle-renamer

Subtitle Renamer is a simple CLI Tool that lets users unify subtitle files with movie files. 
This can be done manually or in automatic mode with `--auto`. 

User might also change subtitle size on the fly to normalize over different vendors of `.srt` files with the `--normalize-subs` option.
